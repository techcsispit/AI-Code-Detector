## Introduction

The **AI Code Detector** (formerly CodeSniffer 3000) is a powerful web-based tool designed to analyze code and estimate the likelihood that it was generated by artificial intelligence. This project addresses the growing need to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written code in educational, professional, and research contexts. As part of "Source Start," an open source event organized by CSI SPIT, we invite developers, data scientists, educators, and AI enthusiasts to contribute by improving detection algorithms, enhancing the user interface, or adding new analysis features.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented
- **Multi-Criteria Analysis** - Evaluates code using 6 different detection algorithms
- **Real-time Feedback** - Instant analysis with detailed explanations
- **User-Friendly Interface** - Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **Percentage Scoring** - Provides likelihood percentage of AI generation
- **Detailed Reporting** - Explains which criteria triggered positive detections
- **Reset Functionality** - Easy-to-use interface with clear options

### üî¨ **Detection Criteria**
1. **Consistent Formatting** - Uniform indentation patterns
2. **Generic Variable Names** - Common non-specific identifiers
3. **Lack of Comments** - Absence of code documentation
4. **Repetitive Patterns** - Repeated code structures
5. **Structured Patterns** - Overly organized logic flows
6. **Code Complexity** - Simplicity vs. sophisticated implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Text editor or IDE for development

### 1. Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Code-Detector.git
   cd AI-Code-Detector
   ```

### 2. Run the Application

1. **Open the detector in your browser:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   start index.html
   
   # On macOS
   open index.html
   
   # On Linux
   xdg-open index.html
   ```

2. **Or use a local server for development:**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using VS Code Live Server extension
   # Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

### 3. Test the Tool

1. **Paste sample code** into the text area
2. **Click "Analyze Code"** to see the detection results
3. **Review the detailed feedback** to understand the analysis

**Example Code to Test:**
```javascript
function getRandomNumber(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}
```

## How It Works

### üîç **Analysis Pipeline**

The AI Code Detector evaluates submitted code through multiple analytical stages:

#### **1. Formatting Analysis**
- **Indentation Consistency** - Checks for uniform spacing and tabs
- **Code Structure** - Analyzes organizational patterns
- **Whitespace Usage** - Evaluates spacing conventions

#### **2. Naming Convention Analysis**
- **Generic Variables** - Detects common AI-preferred names (`data`, `result`, `input`)
- **Naming Patterns** - Analyzes identifier sophistication
- **Context Relevance** - Evaluates variable name appropriateness

#### **3. Documentation Analysis**
- **Comment Presence** - Checks for code documentation
- **Comment Quality** - Evaluates explanation depth
- **Documentation Patterns** - Analyzes commenting styles

#### **4. Structural Analysis**
- **Repetitive Patterns** - Identifies copy-paste-like structures
- **Logic Flow** - Analyzes decision-making patterns
- **Code Organization** - Evaluates architectural choices

#### **5. Complexity Analysis**
- **Algorithmic Sophistication** - Measures implementation complexity
- **Problem-Solving Approach** - Analyzes solution creativity
- **Error Handling** - Evaluates robustness considerations

### üìä **Scoring System**
Each criterion contributes to a weighted score that determines the final AI likelihood percentage:
- **High Scores (70%+)** - Likely AI-generated
- **Medium Scores (30-70%)** - Uncertain origin
- **Low Scores (<30%)** - Likely human-written
